First Java OOP Practice
Description
This repository contains our first practice in Java, where we applied fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this practice, we focused on using inheritance, polymorphism, and other key OOP concepts to create a set of classes that interact with each other.

Objectives
Learn the basics of OOP in Java.
Apply inheritance to create relationships between classes.
Use polymorphism to implement methods with different behaviors based on the object type.
Experiment with encapsulation and abstraction to improve the structure of the code.
Features
Implementation of base classes and subclasses to practice inheritance.
Use of polymorphism to change method behavior depending on the specific object.
Examples of private/protected methods and attributes to demonstrate the use of encapsulation.
Constructors and getter/setter methods to manage object data securely.
